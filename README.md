# Movie-Recommendation-System

##Project Description:
Different algorithms to make recommendations for movies:
1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Using Cosine Similarity
2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Using Pearson Correlation
3. Extensions to the basic user-based collaborative filtering algorithms with Inverse user frequency
4. Extensions to the basic user-based collaborative filtering algorithms with Case modification
5. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
6. Own algorithm

##Running Environment:  Jupyter Notebook

Running Instruction:
